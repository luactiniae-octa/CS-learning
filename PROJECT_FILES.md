## 🎓 Learning Progression

### Phase 1: Getting Started (Day 1-2)
1. Install Python (if not already installed)
2. Run `test_python.py` to verify setup
3. Read `QUICK_START.md` 
4. Run `simple_guessing_game.py`
5. Try modifying small parts of the code

### Phase 2: Understanding Structure (Day 3-7)
1. Read sections 1-6 of `GAME_TUTORIAL.md`
2. Run `number_guessing_game.py`
3. Understand how functions work
4. Try the suggested modifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Programming (Week 2+)
1. Read sections 7-9 of `GAME_TUTORIAL.md`
2. Run `advanced_guessing_game.py`
3. Understand classes and file operations
4. Try building your own features

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### To run the games:
```bash
# Test Python installation first
python test_python.py

# Run the games in order of complexity
python simple_guessing_game.py
python number_guessing_game.py
python advanced_guessing_game.py
```

### If "python" doesn't work, try:
```bash
py test_python.py
python3 test_python.py
```

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will understand:
- **Variables and Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans
- **Control Flow**: if/else statements, while/for loops  
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks
- **Error Handling**: try/except blocks for robust programs
- **User Interface**: Getting input, providing good user experience
- **Code Organization**: Separating concerns, clean code practices
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and methods (advanced version)
- **File Operations**: Saving and loading data (advanced version)

## 🏆 Project Extensions

Once you've mastered these games, try building:
